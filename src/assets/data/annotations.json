        "annotation text 1": "Hogarth's paintings aren't the same thing as realistic photos - Hogarth uses satirical exaggeration, for instance. But the paintings do show how a range of people were able to take part in eighteenth century elections - in different ways - including people who didn't vote, like women. In the Osfordshire election of 1754 (which inspired Hogarth's paintings) for example, Lady Susan Keck was an active campaigner for the Whig, or New Interest, party, and she was both publicly celebrated, and satirized, for this. The first painting includes a woman playing a fiddle, and singing, alongside other musicians, while people are given free food and drink by the two Whig candidates. Hogarth based some of the figures in his paintings on actual people, and this is thought to be a portrait of the Oxfordshire musician, 'Fiddling Nan'. Songs and music were just one way that people who couldn't vote could be involved in eighteenth-century elections, both as audience members and, as in this case, as performers. Songs were written about elections, and, like party political advertisements today, these songs could support or attack particular candidates. They could also be a way to spread\n\"news' about what was going on at an election - and you didn't have to be able to read to be an audience",
        "annotation text 2": "The fiddle player is also wearing a large orange (or 'yellow') rosette, or 'cockade\" made of ribbons; this was associated with support for the Whig party in the election. These are some examples of actual election cockades from the period, including one worn by the Newcastle printer and collector, William Garret.",

        "annotation text 1": "In the eighteenth century, elections often ended with\n\"chairing the winning candidates. This was when politicians were seated in decorated chairs and then carried in triumph through the streets. In Hogarth's satirical painting, the candidate is about to fall out of the chair, because of the fighting going on around him. This reflects the real dangers involved in election chairings, for those being 'chaired, and for others. Hogarth also uses the politician in danger of falling from the chair to suggest that the election victory itself isn't secure but, like the candidate, is about to be overturned. This refers to something that actually happened in Oxfordshire in 1754 when, despite apparently getting the largest number of votes, the victory of the Tory, or Old Interest, candidates was challenged and ultimately overturned (the results of elections were often challenged in the eighteenth century). This raises the question,",
