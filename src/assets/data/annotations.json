But the paintings do show how a range of people were able to take part in eighteenth century elections - in different ways - including people who didn't vote, like women. In the Osfordshire election of 1754 (which inspired Hogarth's paintings) for example, Lady Susan Keck was an active campaigner for the Whig, or New Interest, party, and she was both publicly celebrated, and satirized, for this. The first painting includes a woman playing a fiddle, and singing, alongside other musicians, while people are given free food and drink by the two Whig candidates. Hogarth based some of the figures in his paintings on actual people, and this is thought to be a portrait of the Oxfordshire musician, 'Fiddling Nan'. Songs and music were just one way that people who couldn't vote could be involved in eighteenth-century elections, both as audience members and, as in this case, as performers. Songs were written about elections, and, like party political advertisements today, these songs could support or attack particular candidates. They could also be a way to spread\n\"news' about what was going on at an election - and you didn't have to be able to read to be an audience",

This was when politicians were seated in decorated chairs and then carried in triumph through the streets. In Hogarth's satirical painting, the candidate is about to fall out of the chair, because of the fighting going on around him. This reflects the real dangers involved in election chairings, for those being 'chaired, and for others. Hogarth also uses the politician in danger of falling from the chair to suggest that the election victory itself isn't secure but, like the candidate, is about to be overturned. This refers to something that actually happened in Oxfordshire in 1754 when, despite apparently getting the largest number of votes, the victory of the Tory, or Old Interest, candidates was challenged and ultimately overturned (the results of elections were often challenged in the eighteenth century).

Crowds of voters and non-voters, including women and children, gathered around the hustings. They came to hear the candidates give their speeches at the beginning and end of every day\u2019s polling, and to watch the voters give their votes.

Each candidate and his supporters would arrive at the hustings in the morning by around 9 a.m., before the voting started about 10 a.m.. The processions were theatrical and colourful, with flags and banners flying, bands playing and people bedecked with ribbons and cockades in the candidates\u2019 colours singing election songs. At the end of the day, when the polls closed about 4 or 5 p.m., the processions would form again and the candidates, accompanied by their supporters, and serenaded by their musicians, would lead their processions to their respective headquarters (usually a local tavern, or the house of an important supporter), where there would be more speeches.   \n\nEighteenth-century crowds were not particularly polite and elections were exciting, noisy, and drink-fuelled community events. They were also made up of groups of people who supported the opposing candidates. To keep the peace, candidates hired local men to serve as stavesmen , or special constables. They had staves (or bludgeons: for an example, see https://ecppec.ncl.ac.uk/cultural-artifact-explorer/31257118-e5d8-417c-ab51-626a2006aaa9/) that they could use to protect the candidates in case of a riot, or to break up fights in the crowd. (Note that Hogarth has included a number of staves resting alongside the hustings at the bottom right of this image, as a reminder/) While not everyone could vote in the eighteenth century, anyone could heckle. Candidates were often judged on how well, or how wittily, they dealt with being interrupted. It was customary practice for the candidate who was in the lead at the end of a day\u2019s polling to give the first speech when the polls closed for the day. Usually candidates thanked their supporters and encouraged more votes for the following day, but if a candidate said something was seen as disrespectful of the voters themselves, the result could be an immediate riot, as was the case in Bedford in 1830: https://ecppec.ncl.ac.uk/features/bedford-1830-riot-and-respectability/ ",

The Bribery oath, which was often demanded in particularly heated elections, where treating had bled over into bribery and corruption, required voters to swear that they had not been bribed in any way and that they were casting their votes independently. \n\nOath-taking was a serious business in the eighteenth century. It required voters to speak the truth before God, with one hand on the Bible. It also had serious legal implications: being prosecuted for lying under oath \u2014 the crime of perjury \u2014 could result in fines ranging from \u00a320 to \u00a3500 (multiply by 60 to get a modern equivalent).

It owes its origins to the comic figure of Polichinello in the Italian Commedia del Arte and, especially in England, the marionette of Punch that featured in the popular puppet Punch and Joan shows that toured eighteenth-century England. Exactly when the figure of Punch became politicized is uncertain, but we know that it was being used politically in publications from the 1720s. ",

In both cases, the results of the elections were overturned on charges of bribery and corruption. In the case of Hindon, the bribery was so blatant that the unseated candidates were sentenced to 6 months in prison and fined 1,000 marks (nearly \u00a360,000 in today\u2019s money). ",

Interestingly, though, Hogarth seems to be suggesting that even the cobbler has been \u2018bought\u2019 in this election, as he is covering a collection of coins with his hand.\n\nHogarth is using recent 18th century naval history to make a political point here that would have been obvious to his contemporaries. The local barber and cobbler are seated in front of the Porto Bello inn. The inn sign can be made out above the barber\u2019s head and his forefinger points out the name of the inn on his tankard. The cobbler, smoking his pipe and with a shoe on the table beside him, is listening to the barber (presumably an ex-naval barber-surgeon), who is using his pipe to point at a curved line of pipe stems. He is recounting \u2014 and demonstrating \u2014 Admiral Edward Vernon\u2019s successful defeat of the Spanish navy at Portobello in 1739. ",
        "annotation text 1": "Admiral Edward Vernon was a popular hero, with a well-established reputation for both personal integrity and political independence. Hogarth has drawn on this reputation by placing the Porto Bello inn directly opposite the Tories\u2019 tavern, The Royal Oak, where the corrupt canvassing is taking place. To drive the reference home, he has also included the carved figurehead of the British Lion eating a French fleur-de-lys directly across from the barber\u2019s Porto Bello tankard. This figurehead came from another famous ship, Admiral Lord Anson\u2019s HMS Centurion, in which he circumnavigated the globe in 1744. \n\nAdmiral Lord Anson was a Whig politician and longstanding member of the government. Hogarth is using this representative of his naval achievement to criticize him as a member of the political elite and a member of the government to suggest that even achievements of Whigs like Anson could be appropriated politically and tarnished through their proximity to electoral corruption. It is worth noting, though, that in actuality Anson\u2019s leadership of the Royal Navy was crucial to restoring British naval power and securing British naval superiority (and the defeat of the French) by mid-century.",

The lion represents the figurehead of a famous ship, Admiral Lord Anson\u2019s HMS Centurion, in which he successfully completed the first circumnavigation of the globe in 1744. This made Admiral Lord Anson a popular naval hero. He was, however, also a political insider, a leading Whig politician and longstanding member of the government (he rose to become First Lord of the Admiralty). Hogarth is using the figurehead here to contrast Anson as a political insider with the political independence of another naval hero, the politically independent Admiral Admiral Edward Vernon. Vernon was famous for his successful defeat of the Spanish navy at Portobello in 1739.

This was in itself very unpopular across the country, but it was the powers of search that the bill would have given to hated excisemen that spawned a petitioning and press campaign, and resulted in the bill\u2019s withdrawal. In the government\u2019s desire to cut down on smuggling and ensure that the excise on goods was paid, it would have granted excisemen not only the right to enter and search private individual\u2019s houses, force open their trunks and cupboards, and reverse the burden of proof. In other words, an exciseman could presume that individuals were guilty of harbouring smuggled goods, or avoiding the excise, and it was up to the individual to prove they were not. It would have overturned the very important English belief in a right to privacy (the common belief that an Englishman\u2019s home was his castle), as well as threatening the fundamental political belief in innocent until proven guilty. Hogarth is bringing all of this together to suggest that the Whigs were all about high taxation as well as posing a threat to the traditional rights and liberties of the English populace. ",
